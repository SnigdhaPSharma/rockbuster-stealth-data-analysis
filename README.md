Analysis of the Rockbuster Stealth LLC Data using SQL



**Project Brief:**
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service to stay competitive.
As a data analyst at Rockbuster Stealthâ€™s business intelligence (BI) department, my job is to help with the launch strategy for the new online video service. The BI department helps other departments, from inventory to customer insights, with data-related queries.
